## 1. Introduction

This repository is dedicated to educational Go programming and includes code examples, tutorials, and small projects. The goal is to help you learn Go through hands-on experience with various programming concepts.

The code provided here is for educational purposes only and may not be suitable for production use without further development and testing.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before getting started with the code examples in this repository, you should have the following prerequisites:

- Go programming language installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts and Go syntax.

## 3. Code Structure

The code in this repository is organized into various directories, each focusing on a different educational topic or concept. Below are some of the key directories you will find:

<!-- - **`basics/`**: Contains simple Go programs that cover basic syntax, data types, and control structures.

- **`data-structures/`**: Demonstrates the implementation of common data structures in Go, such as linked lists, stacks, and queues. -->

- **`concurrency/`**: Features code examples to explore concurrent programming in Go, including goroutines, channels, and synchronization.

- **`large-file-streamer/`**: Features a simple file transfer server and client written in Go. The server listens on a specified port for incoming file transfers, while the client generates and sends a random file to the server.

- **`simple-api/`**: Features a simple Go application for building a RESTful API using the Echo web framework.

<!-- - **`file-io/`**: Demonstrates file input and output operations in Go, including reading and writing files.

- **`api-integration/`**: Includes code for integrating with APIs and making HTTP requests using Go. -->

Each directory contains README files with explanations and instructions for each code example or project.
