## 1. Introduction

This directory provides a practical example of handling file operations in the Go programming language. The code showcases how to create a file, write data to it, read the file's content, and append new data to an existing file. This educational example is suitable for Go beginners and serves as a starting point for working with file I/O.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Go installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Go programming.
- Proper permissions to create and modify files in your working directory.

## 3. Code Structure

The project consists of a single Go source file:

- `main.go`: The main entry point of the application, containing code for performing file I/O operations.

## 4. Getting Started

To get started with this code example:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory.

3. Run the code using the `go run main.go` command from the terminal.

The code will create, read, and append data to a sample text file and display the results in the terminal.

## 5. File Operations

The code demonstrates the following file operations:

- **Creating a File**: It creates a new file, "sample.txt," and writes initial content to it.

- **Reading a File**: It reads the content of the "sample.txt" file and displays it in the terminal.

- **Appending to a File**: It opens the file in append mode, adds new content to it, and reads the updated content.
